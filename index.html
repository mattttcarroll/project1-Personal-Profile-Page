        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Matt is an aspiring web designer who has a cat and takes long walks on the beach. Ok not really! There are no pets, but he does have three boys ages 5, 6, and 7 who create enough of a mess of their own! A cat would be much easier, and there are no beaches in Dayton, Ohio!</p>
        <img src="img/threeboys.jpg" alt="The boys" class="boys-image">        
        <p>Matt tries to be a good dad and models a life of creativity and learning for his boys. We all have more to learn and we all have something creative to contribute!</p>
